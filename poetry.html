                    <h1> Ode to The Difference Engine </h1>
                    <p> Oh Difference Engine, you were made in 1822 <br>
                        What would I <em>ever </em>do without you? <br>
                         <br>
                        Oh Difference Engine, you were made by Mr. Charles Babbage <br>
                        I would call you a calculation savage <br>
                        <br>
                        You were made to autonomate calculations <br>
                        Used to solve mathmatical equations <br>
                        <br>
                        Once the Difference Engine came <br>
                        Then arrived the World Wide Web's fame <br>
                        <br>
                        Oh Difference Engine, we thank you <br>
                        Oh Difference Engine, where would we be without you?
                        <br>
                        </p>
